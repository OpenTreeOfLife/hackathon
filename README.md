hackathon
=========

[Open Tree of Life](http://opentreeoflife.org), [Arbor](http://www.arborworkflows.com/) and [HIP](http://www.evoio.org/wiki/HIP) are jointly hosting a hackathon for testing, expanding and buiding up on the [Open Tree of Life APIs](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/opentree/wiki/Open-Tree-of-Life-APIs). This repository is a place to generate and discuss potential projects ideas. 

Hashtag: [#treeforall](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23treeforall&src=typd)

To begin, create a GitHub account and sign in. Then, click the [Issues](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/hackathon/issues) link on the right sidebar to browse the current list of issues. From here, you can:
* comment on existing ideas, if you find something interesting, have questions or suggestions.  You can "tag" another GitHub user by including @username in the comment, or you can reference another issue by using #. 
* add a new issue by clicking the friendly green "New Issue" button. Add a short, descriptive title and a longer description. Again, you can tag users or other issues in the description.
